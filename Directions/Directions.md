1. Download VS-Code
2. Open VS-Code
3. Hit ```CTRL + N``` to open a new file
4. Select the language ```HTML```
5. Once the HTML file is opened, enter a ```!```, then hit ```Tab``` or ```Enter``` to have the editor auto complete the HTML format 
6. You should now have something like this
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```
7. We have now made our html file, save and name the file `index.html` [(html file)](/HTML/index.html)
8. You can now make any edits you want to the file to fit your project, CSS and JS would be some next steps for more complex projects
9. Now create an account on Github and login
10. Create a new public repository and name it whatever you want
11. Now drag and drop your `index.html` file into your repo
12. Next, Go to your repo settings and go to `Pages`
13. For `Branch`, click on `Main` unless you made another branch
14. Keep the folder as `/root` and then hit save
15. You can now go to the `Actions` tab, near the `Settings` tab and watch it build
16. Once it has built, go back to the `Pages` section in `Settings` and click on your new website link, GitHub automatically looks for a `index.html` file when using pages
